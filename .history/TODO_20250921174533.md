# Testing Plan for Authentication and /student Endpoint

## Critical-Path Testing
- Verify that the password stored in the database is plain text if using NoOpPasswordEncoder.
- Verify that the username exists in the database.
- Verify that the UserDetailsService correctly loads the user by username.
- Verify that the password returned by UserPrincipal matches the database password.
- Verify that SecurityConfig uses NoOpPasswordEncoder or appropriate password encoder.

## Thorough Testing
- Test the /student GET endpoint with:
  - Valid username and password (should return 200 and list of students).
  - Invalid username (should return 401 Unauthorized).
  - Invalid password (should return 401 Unauthorized).
